# Price Locking Application

This is a **Spring Boot** web application for managing products in an e-commerce system, with a special feature for **locking product prices**. Users can lock a productâ€™s price at a discount for 10 days and purchase the product within that timeframe. The application is built using **Spring Boot**, **JSP**, and **Hibernate** for the backend, and **Bootstrap** for styling.

## Features

- Display a list of products with their offer prices.
- Lock a product price for a period of 10 days with a customizable discount.
- Purchase a product at the locked price.
- Automatically unlock the product price if the purchase is not made within 10 days.
- Built with **Spring Boot**, **JSP**, **Hibernate**, and **Bootstrap**.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: For backend application logic and embedded Tomcat.
- **JSP**: For rendering the frontend.
